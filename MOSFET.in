MOSFET Simulation
Aim:
To design, simulate, and analyze the electrical characteristics of an n-channel MOSFET using Silvaco TCAD ATLAS. The simulation will define the MOSFET geometry, material regions, doping concentrations, and electrode placements to generate I–V characteristics for specified gate voltages.

Device Specifications:

Channel Length (L): 0.05 μm

Gate Oxide Thickness (t_ox): 0.002 μm (2 nm)

Source and Drain Regions: Highly doped n-type silicon

Substrate: P-type silicon with high doping concentration

Air Region: Above gate oxide for simulation environment boundary

Width: 0.25 μm total simulation domain in X-direction

Height: 0.016 μm total simulation domain in Y-direction

Simulation Requirements:

Mesh Definition:

Fine mesh in critical regions (gate oxide, channel) for higher accuracy.

Coarser mesh in non-critical areas to optimize runtime.

Regions:

Region 1: Air (for environment boundary)

Region 2: Gate oxide (SiO₂)

Regions 3, 5: Source and drain silicon

Region 4: Channel silicon

Doping:

Source/Drain: n-type, 1×10¹⁸ cm⁻³

Channel: p-type, 1×10²⁰ cm⁻³

Gate oxide: n-type, 1×10¹⁸ cm⁻³ (as per given script)

Electrodes:

Drain: Left silicon contact

Gate: Above oxide region

Source: Right silicon contact

Models:

bipolar, fldmob (field-dependent mobility model)

Biasing & Analysis:

Fixed V_G = 0.5 V

V_D swept from 0 V to 3 V in 0.1 V steps

Output: Drain current (I_D) vs. Drain voltage (V_D)
